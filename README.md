# 🚀 Code Review Agent

An AI-powered code review assistant that automatically analyzes source code and provides actionable feedback on security, maintainability, and best practices.

# 📖 Background

Modern software development demands high standards of code quality and security. Manual code reviews are labor-intensive and may miss subtle bugs, security flaws, or deviations from best practices.

With the advancement of artificial intelligence, this project aims to automate code review and provide developers with rapid, expert-level feedback—helping them ship safer and more efficient code.

# 🎯 Challenge

The Code Review Agent analyzes source code and provides:

✅ Actionable suggestions for improving code based on industry best practices

🔒 Detection of security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, insecure API usage)

🛠 Refactoring recommendations to enhance maintainability and performance

📊 Summary report highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and remediation steps

# 📂 Features

📥 Accepts one or more source code files or snippets (Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.)

⚡ Provides AI-driven feedback on code quality and vulnerabilities

🖥 Web UI for uploading code and viewing results

🔧 Suggestions for auto-remediation (future feature)

🌍 (Optional) Mockups showing how comments and alerts would appear in GitHub/GitLab/IDEs

🔄 Real-time checks via CI/CD pipelines (planned)

# 🛠 Tech Stack
